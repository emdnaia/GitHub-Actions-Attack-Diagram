# GitHub Actions Attack Diagram

This GitHub Actions Attack Diagram designed to support talks I delivered with [Adnan Khan ](https://adnanthekhan.com/) at Black Hat USA 2024 ([Continuous Integration, Continuous Desctruction](https://www.blackhat.com/us-24/briefings/schedule/index.html#self-hosted-github-cicd-runners-continuous-integration-continuous-destruction-38308)) and DEF CON 32 ([Grand Theft Actions](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-32/dc-32-speakers.html#54489)).

The goal of the diagram is to provide guidance to identifying GitHub Actions vulnerabilities from two perspectives: Read-only access to a GitHub repository, or write-access to a GitHub repository. This diagram outlines common attack paths Adnan and I have used on Red Team engagements and during public vulnerability research. Throughout the diagram, various resources are linked to provide additional context.

These attack paths may change over time as GitHub updates their internal configurations. If you notice that certain TTPs are no longer valid, or to request the addition of new TTPs, please leave an Issue comment. 

This diagram is not inclusive, rather, it outlines major attack paths and TTPs we have used on targets in live environments.
